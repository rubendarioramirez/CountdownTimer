# CountdownTimer
River App

Developped in Android Studio 2.2 BETA. However it doesnt use any new or exclusive feature. So should be backwards compatible.

To run the project:

Change your Facebook and Twitter credentials. They are located on STRING values + Splash screen activity for Twitter.
Make sure to update URL variable that's used in several parts of the application if you want to change the server.

FetchTaskActivity it's custom for the specific JSON file and parse it as it's. If you want to add or remove info from the FEED do make the necesary changes on this activity.

Service class manages both Widget and Main application timer, do all pertinent changes there.

The rest, just build and enjoy.
